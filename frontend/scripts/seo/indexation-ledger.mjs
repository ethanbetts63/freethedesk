/**
 * Asserts that every public route carries exactly one true indexation policy.
 *
 * `check-sitemap-routes.mjs` guards the outward direction — a listed route with
 * no page. This is the inward direction: a new public route nobody added to any
 * bucket, which is otherwise indistinguishable from a forgotten one. Every
 * route must land in exactly one of:
 *
 *   - `STATIC_PAGES`           (lib/pages.ts)            — listed
 *   - `STATIC_NOINDEX_PAGES`   (lib/pages.ts)            — noindex
 *   - `REDIRECT_STUBS`         (lib/pages.ts)            — redirect only
 *   - `DYNAMIC_ROUTE_FAMILIES` (lib/pages.ts)            — generated from data
 *   - the robots.txt `*` group                           — disallowed
 *
 * *Exactly* one, not at least one. seo-standard.md section 2 forbids a route
 * being both disallowed and noindexed: a disallowed page is never crawled, so
 * its noindex is never read, and it can still surface as a bare URL with no
 * title.
 *
 * Both sides are read as VALUES, not as source text. The registry is imported
 * (see ts-loader.mjs) and robots.txt is taken from the route's own `GET()`, so
 * what this checks is the bytes a crawler receives rather than a regex's guess
 * at what the file says. Formatting, quoting style, comments and computed
 * entries all stop being load-bearing.
 *
 * State 4 resolves from the `*` group alone. The AI group is deliberately more
 * permissive (seo-standard.md section 4); reading the union would make a page
 * opened to answer engines look undeclared.
 *
 * A dynamic family's per-record correctness cannot be evaluated here — it
 * depends on data this has no access to. What can be checked is that the
 * family still points at something real: `policyModule` exists, and
 * `policySymbol` still appears in it. That is the rot the field was previously
 * open to, a resolver renamed with its declaration left behind.
