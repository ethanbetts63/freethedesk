/**
 * The frontend baseline, held by a script instead of a table in a document.
 *
 * Shared engine — edit it in `freetheplatform/frontend/registry/tooling/` and
 * re-sync, never in a product. It is deliberately self-contained: the pinned
 * list is family policy, not a repo fact, so changing it is a registry edit
 * that lands everywhere in one sync.
 *
 * frontend-baseline.md's rule is that the three products run one baseline —
 * the registry ships components by byte-copy, so a version skew means the
 * copy is not the thing that was tested. This script holds the part of that
 * rule that is already true:
 *
 * - PINNED packages must be declared identically in all three repos. Fail.
 * - BASELINE packages should be, but the family has not leveled them yet —
 *   the sequence is in _docs/frontend-baseline-outstanding.md. Warn, count.
 *   When a leveling step lands, move its packages into PINNED in the same
 *   change; that is the step becoming permanent.
 *
 * Run from any repo in the family. When the sibling repos are not present
 * (Vercel, CI, a lone clone) there is nothing to compare, so it says so and
 * exits 0 — the check is about the family, and only means something where
 * the family is.
 *
